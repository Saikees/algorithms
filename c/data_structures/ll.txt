reverse linked list

    p -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL

    // initialize prev to NULL (note that prev changes over time)
    prev -> NULL // essentially takes the place of the list-terminating NULL

    // correct order of operations uses the right-hand arg in current line
    // as the left-hand arg of the next line.

    // part below is done in a while loop until p is NULL

    tmp = p->next (2)
    p->next = prev (NULL)
    prev = p (1)
    p = tmp (2)

    prev -> 1 -> NULL

    tmp = p->next (3)
    p->next = prev (1)
    prev = p (2)
    p = tmp (3)

    prev -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
    p = 3 ->  NULL

    // after all operations, prev is now the reversed list.
