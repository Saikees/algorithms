Algorithms
-----------------------------

1. Write code to find the second shortest path between two given nodes in an undirected graph.

2. (solved) Partition an array in such a way that zeroes are moved to the left side of the array
   and all other numbers to the right side of the array. In-place only.
    - c/lzero.c

3. * Given an array of integers and another integer, determine if the array of integers
   can be manipulated into equaling the second integer using standard math operations.
    - similar to subset sum problem

4. (solved) Find integer pairs in an integer array so that they sum up to a specific number N.
    - c/find_int_pairs/main.c

5. (solved) Reverse a string in-place. "hello world" -> "dlrow olleh"
    - Reverse a string's words. "hello world" -> "world hello"
    - c/strrev.c

6. Print all the shortest paths in a grid (Cartesian), given the starting point
   and ending point.

7. Write a regular expression to match a machine's MAC address.

8. * (solved) Write an algorithm to test if N is a power of 2.
    - N = 8 is a power of 2 (2^3)
    - log2n (binary logarithm) will do this. log2(8) == 3, pow(2, 3) == 8
    - c/power_of_two.c

9. * (solved) Given two numbers, X and Y, check if X is an integer power of Y.
    - X = Y^n
    - same idea as binary logarithm: logY(X) == n, pow(Y, n) == X
    - c/power_of_two.c

10. Write mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, etc. on-the-fly.

11. Given a set of shapes in 2D space and a coordinate pair, write a function
    that returns true if any of the shapes overlap the coordinate pair.

12. * Given a matrix, print it clockwise from the first element to the very inner
    element.
    - "spiral print a 2D array"
    - Are the dimensions known / passed as arguments?
    - Seems like graph traversal

    [ ]->[ ]->[ ]
               |
               v
    [ ]->[ ]->[ ]
     ^         |
     |         v
    [ ]<-[ ]<-[ ]

13. Write a function to merge two sorted arrays.

14. Each key on a phone represents a set of letters. Given a phone number,
    write a program to output all the possible strings the phone number represents.
    - Permutations

15. Given a string, remove all characters from the string that are present in another
    string called 'filter'.
    - Does this mean if any character is in filter it needs to be removed from source string?
    - Or does it mean to remove substrings that match filter?

16. Given two events, each with a start and end time, write a function that
    returns true if the events overlap.

17. (solved) Write a backtracking algorithm to solve the n-queens problem.
    - c/queens.c

    n-queens problem: place n-queens in a nxn chess board so that they
    can't attack eachother. Solution for 4-queens problem is below:

    [ ] [X] [ ] [ ]

    [ ] [ ] [ ] [X]

    [X] [ ] [ ] [ ]

    [ ] [ ] [X] [ ]

18. (solved) Find the weighted midpoint of an array by the sum of two subsequences.
    - split the array into two subsequences that have equal (or near-equal) sums
      and print the midpoint value.
    - c/mid.c

19. (solved) Write an algorithm to generate all permutations of a string.
    - c/permute.c uses the heap permute algorithm.

20. * (solved) Compute a^n for positive integer exponents.
    - c/power.c
    - basic idea is to keep multiplying a by itself n times.

    int power(int a, int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return a;
        return a*power(a, n-1);
    }

    int power2(int a, int n) {
        int i, res = a;
        for (i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            res *= a;
        }
        return res;
    }

21. Graph coloring problem
    - assign the smallest number of colors to vertices of a graph
      so that no two adjacent vertices are the same color.

22. Write an algorithm to detect the largest palindrome in a string.
23. * Find intersection of two (unsorted) arrays.
24. Find a number in an array that's repeated an odd number of times.
25. How to sort 100 million 10-bit integers.
26. Given a reference to a node in a BST, find the immediate ancestor.
27. How would you find duplicates in two unsorted integer arrays?
28. Find second largest number in an array. Find the Nth largest number in an array.
29. Design a garbage collector.
    - how is garbage collection performed?
    - how to determine what is and isn't garbage?
30. Find a pythagorean triplet from an array
31. fibonacci algorithm
32. * Write a function to count the number of words in a string.
34. * subset-sum problem
    - in linear time? is that a trick question?

4. Graph theory; Write a function to check if a graph is bipartite (a bigraph).
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph

5. Given two binary trees, write a function that returns true if their elements are
   the same, irrespective of the trees' structures.
